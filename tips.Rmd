- UTMS!
- Scale of response
- Scale of predictors
- Experiment with low resolution meshes
- You may not need a super high resolution mesh
- Plot, plot, plot
- Start simple
- Don't get too caught up on model configuration
- These are complex models; they may take a while to fit and it's very easy to find a configuration that will not converge.
- There are a lot of things possible that I have not covered:
  - Time-varying spatial variance
  - Spatially varying slopes
  - Interpolation over missing years
  - Forecasting on future years
