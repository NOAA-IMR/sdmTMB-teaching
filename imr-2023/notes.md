Timing:
* thinking May? Partially for settling in, plus having Brian around
* time zone: Bergen is +9 hours ahead of BC / WA

Format:
* decisions: in person? hybrid? 
* how many participants? open it up to other folks in Norway / academics / etc?
* Brian / Kot can help

Days: Sean / Philina / Lewis / Eric have done several iterations of these over the last few years. We have material prepared for 3-4 1/2 days (~ 1-1.5 hours of lectures, 1 hour of exercies, 30 min of Q&A). 
* decisions: all material in 2 days? versus 1/2 days for 3-4?
