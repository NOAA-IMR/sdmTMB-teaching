# Spatial and spatiotemporal models with sdmTMB for estimating species distribution and index standardization

### [Slides and exercises](https://pbs-assess.github.io/sdmTMB-teaching/imr-2023/)

In this course, we will introduce fitting spatial and spatiotemporal generalized linear mixed effects models (GLMMs) with Gaussian random fields. Such models are increasingly used for species distribution modelling and survey index standardization. They can be particularly useful when accounting for differences in survey protocols or incorporating climate variables. We will introduce this class of models and focus on fitting and understanding them with sdmTMBâ€”an R package with a flexible and user-friendly interface.

Topics will include:
* An introduction to Gaussian random fields
* An introduction to the sdmTMB R package
* Spatial random field GLMMs
* Spatiotemporal random field GLMMs
* Two-part delta or hurdle models for zero inflation
* Time-varying and spatially varying coefficients
* Forecasting
* Index standardization
* Model checking and comparison
* Depending on attendee interest as gauged before the workshop, we can touch on
  or substitute other advanced topics (e.g., simulation, fitting the models with
  Stan, presence-only data).

Attendees should have an intermediate knowledge of R and some experience with GLMs and mixed effects models (e.g., using glm(), mgcv, lme4, or glmmTMB). While all examples will use sdmTMB, similarly structured models can be fit with INLA or VAST and so the concepts will also be applicable to participants using these packages. The workshop will consist of presentations, tutorials, and group exercises with the support of instructors.
