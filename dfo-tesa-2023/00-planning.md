# Day 1

### Lectures:

-   Intro to RFs
-   Intro to sdmTMB
-   Spatial example

### Exercises:

-   Matern correlation
-   Simulating spatial RFs
-   Simulating spatiotemporal RFs
-   Fitting a basic spatial model (plus print(), sanity(), tidy())

# Day 2

### Lectures:

-   Recap
-   Spatiotemporal example
-   Calculating an index with that model
-   Try that index with different model structures

### Exercises:

-   Plotting output from a spatial model from Day 1
-   Fitting a spatiotemporal model
-   Inspecting output that model in many ways
    -   sanity(), residuals(), simulate() [e.g., proportion zeros]

# Day 3

### Lectures:

-   Recap
-   Spatial varying example
-   Comparing models

### Exercises:

-   Fitting a spatial-varying model
-   Comparing 2 models with AIC and cross validation

# Day 4

-   Recap
-   Extrapolation and forecasting
-   Barrier models
-   Priors (especially PC prior)

### Exercises:

-   Forecasting 3 years with `extra_time`?
-   Add a PC prior?
-   A series of models with problems: find those problems (e.g., with sanity(), print(), tidy(), and/or residuals()), suggest how they might be solved.

# TODO

-   Add sanity() in lectures and lessons
-   Do we cover residuals() well?
-   Turn 05-extra (words of wisdom) into trouble shooting, diagnostics for day 4
