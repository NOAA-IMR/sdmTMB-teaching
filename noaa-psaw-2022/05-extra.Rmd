# Troubleshooting

# Example of non-converging model

.small[
```{r pcod-spatial-rf, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE, warning=FALSE}
mesh <- make_mesh(pcod, xy_cols = c("X", "Y"), cutoff = 10)

fit <- sdmTMB(
  present ~ depth * year,
  data = pcod,
  mesh = mesh,
  family = binomial(link = "logit"),
  spatial = "on"
)
```

```r
#> Warning message:
#> The model may not have converged: 
#> non-positive-definite Hessian matrix. 
```
]
---

# Who is Hessian and why are they not "positive definite"?

* A Hessian matrix is a matrix of second derivatives of a function (here the negative log likelihoood surface)

--

* The inverse of the negative Hessian is the covariance matrix

--

* Warning means the curvature of the negative log-likelihood surface is inconsistent with the model having found the best fit.

--

* Overparameterized? Variance estimated near zero?

--

# Inspecting output

One or more standard errors being `NaN` is a problem:

.small[
```{r, echo=TRUE, highlight.output=10}
fit
```
]

---

# Inspecting output

We could also look directly at the TMB `sdreport`:

.small[
```{r, echo=TRUE, highlight.output=c(6, 9, 10, 11)}
fit$sd_report
```
]

---

# Looking at gradients

Log likelihood gradient with respect to fixed effects:

.small[
```{r, echo=TRUE}
max(fit$gradients)
```
]

* Gradient becomes smaller as likelihood surface becomes flatter at the location in parameter space

--

* Flatter surface = closer to point of maximum likelihood

--

* So, small values are consistent with convergence (no hard rule, perhaps at least < 0.001)

---

# Interpretation

* Linear interaction term seems tricky to estimate

* Solutions:
  * make sure the model is identifiable
  * drop linear interaction (maybe not important)
  * try re-scaling predictors
  * try a different mesh setup
  * simplify some other part of the model
  * try a related fixed-effect structure, e.g., non-linear smooths
  
---

# Smooth effects by year

Separate smooths by year:

```{r eval = FALSE, echo=TRUE}
pcod$fyear <- as.factor(pcod$year)
fit <- sdmTMB(
  present ~ s(depth, by = fyear), #<<
  data = pcod,
  mesh = mesh,
  family = binomial(link = "logit"),
  spatial = "on"
)
```

---

# 2D smooth effects

year x depth as smooth interaction:

```{r eval = FALSE, echo=TRUE}
fit <- sdmTMB(
  present ~ s(depth, year), #<<
  data = pcod,
  mesh = mesh,
  family = binomial(link = "logit"),
  spatial = "on"
)
```

---
 
# Other warning messages / diagnostics

* `Matrix` package, compiler warnings
  * generally OK, but see glmmTMB page:  
    <https://glmmtmb.github.io/glmmTMB/>

* TMB users forum

# Words of wisdom

**Start simple!**

* These are complex models:
  * They may take a while to fit
  * Easy to create configurations that won't converge
  * Can also be hard to wrap your head around

---

# Words of wisdom

Options for starting simple:
  * start intercept only
  * start with a spatial not spatiotemporal model
  * start without random fields:  
    `spatial = 'off', spatiotemporal = 'off'`
  * start with coarse meshes, maybe increase later  
    (*mesh resolution greatly impacts speed*)

---

# More words of wisdom


--

* Make lots of plots

--

* Don't get too caught up in model configuration

--

* Work in constant distance coordinates (e.g., UTMs)

--

* Consider the scale of the response and predictors

--

* Try other approaches: will a similar model converge in `mgcv`?

--

* Is observation error variance >> process variance?  
  Known to be problematic for state-space models.
