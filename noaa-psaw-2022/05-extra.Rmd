# Troubleshooting

---

# Who is Hessian and why are they not "positive definite"??

* A Hessian matrix is a matrix of second derivatives of a function (here the negative log likelihoood surface)
* The inverse of the negative Hessian is the covariance matrix
* Warning means the curvature of the negative log-likelihood surface is inconsistent with the model having found the best fit.
* Overparameterized? Variance estimated near zero?
* See [vignette("troubleshooting", "glmmTMB")](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/glmmTMB/vignettes/troubleshooting.html)

# Example of non-converging model

.small[
```{r pcod-spatial-rf, echo=TRUE, message=TRUE, warning=TRUE}
mesh <- make_mesh(pcod, xy_cols = c("X", "Y"), cutoff = 10)

fit <- sdmTMB(
  present ~ depth*year,
  data = pcod,
  mesh = mesh,
  family = binomial(link = "logit"),
  spatial = "on"
)
```
]
---

# Inspecting output

* One or more SEs being NaN is a problem  
.small[
```{r, echo=TRUE, highlight.output=c(6)}
fit$sd_report
```
]

---

# What does b_j represent?

```{r}
present ~ depth*year
```

Interpretation: 
$$b_1 + b_2*depth+b_3*year+b_4*depth:year$$
* Linear interaction term seems tricky to estimate
* Solutions:
  * drop linear interaction (maybe not important)
  * explore non-linear smooths
  
---

# Smooth effects by year

* Separate smooths with unique wiggliness

```{r eval = FALSE, echo=TRUE}
pcod$fyear = as.factor(pcod$year)
fit <- sdmTMB(
  present ~ s(depth, by=fyear),
  data = pcod,
  mesh = mesh,
  family = binomial(link = "logit"),
  spatial = "on"
)
```

---

# 2D smooth effects

* year x depth as smooth interaction
```{r eval = FALSE, echo=TRUE}
fit <- sdmTMB(
  present ~ s(depth, by=year),
  data = pcod,
  mesh = mesh,
  family = binomial(link = "logit"),
  spatial = "on"
)
```

* `Matrix` package, compiler warnings

# Words of wisdom

* Start simple
  * intercept only
  * no spatial varying / time varying parameters
  * drop spatial / spatiotemporal fields  
  
* Try other approaches: will a similar model converge in `mgcv`?

* Is observation error variance >> process variance?
  * known to be problematic for state-space models
