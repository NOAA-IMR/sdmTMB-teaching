# Time-varying intercept

Several ways in sdmTMB

* factors: `as.factor(year)` (independent)
* random effects: ` + (1 | year)` (drawn from normal distribution)
* smooth: ` + s(year)` (smoother)
* as random walk (shown next)

#  Random walk covariates in sdmTMB

Random walk:

$$
\begin{aligned}
x_t &= x_{t-1} + \epsilon_t\\
\epsilon &\sim \mathrm{Normal(0, \sigma^2)}
\end{aligned}
$$

Defined by `time_varying` argument

Takes a formula

Note: initial coefficient is unconstrained, i.e. do not place same covariate in 
the `formula` argument.


---

# Time-varying intercept

Note: a `0` or `-1` in formula for suppressing global intercept

Otherwise, both the main effects and time-varying effects would have the same parameter and this can't be estimated.

.small[
```{r tv-int, echo = TRUE}
mesh <- make_mesh(pcod, xy_cols = c("X", "Y"), cutoff = 10)

  density ~ 0 + s(depth, k = 5), 
  time_varying = ~ 1, #<<
  data = pcod, mesh = mesh,
  time = "year",  
  family = tweedie(link = "log")
)
```

# Getting coefficients 

Or by digging into `fit$sd_report`

(Not yet in `tidy.sdmTMB()`.)

```{r b-rw-est, echo=TRUE}
library(TMB)
est <- as.list(fit$sd_report, "Est")
est_se <- as.list(fit$sd_report, "Std. Error")
cbind(est$b_rw_t, est_se$b_rw_t)
```

---

# Other approaches to modeling time-varying intercept

```{r eval = FALSE, echo=TRUE}
density ~ s(depth) + 0 + as.factor(year)
```

```{r eval = FALSE, echo=TRUE}
density ~ s(depth) + (1 | year)
```

```{r eval = FALSE, echo=TRUE}
density ~ s(depth) + s(year, k = 7) # 7 years; not necessary
```

---

# These approaches are similar but subtly different

```{r compare-fits, echo=FALSE}
fit_fc <- sdmTMB(
  density ~ s(depth, k = 5) + as.factor(year),
  data = pcod, mesh = mesh,
  time = "year",
  family = tweedie(link = "log")

nd$fyear <- as.factor(nd$year)

  density ~ s(depth, k = 5) + (1 | fyear),

# just make predictions on avg depth / location
newdf <- data.frame(
  depth = mean(pcod$depth),
  year = unique(pcod$year)

Intercept in this model NOT time-varying

# Time-varying coefficients

Time-varying (random walk) effect of depth

<!-- To plot these, we make a data frame that contains all combinations of the time-varying covariate and time. This is easily created using `expand.grid()` or `tidyr::expand_grid()`. -->

```{r tv-depth-eff}
nd <- expand.grid(
  depth_scaled = seq(min(pcod$depth_scaled) + 0.2,
    max(pcod$depth_scaled) - 0.2, length.out = 100),
  year = unique(pcod$year)
)
nd$depth_scaled2 <- nd$depth_scaled^2
p <- predict(fit_tv, newdata = nd, se_fit = TRUE, re_form = NA)

p$depth <- exp(nd$depth_scaled * pcod$depth_sd[1] + pcod$depth_mean[1])
ggplot(p, aes(depth, exp(est),
  ymin = exp(est - 1 * est_se),
  ymax = exp(est + 1 * est_se),
  group = as.factor(year)
)) +
  geom_line(aes(colour = year), lwd = 1) +
  geom_ribbon(aes(fill = year), alpha = 0.1) +
  coord_cartesian(expand = FALSE, xlim = c(min(pcod$depth), 300)) +
  labs(x = "Depth (m)", y = "Biomass density (kg/km2)")

# Time-varying coefficient notes

* `time_varying` is a formula for coefficients that follow a random walk over time
* Make sure a coefficient isn't in both `formula` and `time_varying`, this includes the intercept
* The `time_varying` formula cannot have smoothers `s()` in it! Instead:
  * Use polynomials `time_varying = x + I(x^2)`
  * Use `formula = s(depth, by = factor_year)` (depth smoothers *independent* by year)
  * Use `formula = s(depth, year)` (2D smooth)

Example use: [English et al. (2021)](https://doi.org/10.1111/faf.12613).
* Wanted to include depth in model, didn't want to constrain fish if they were moving deeper when water was warmer.
